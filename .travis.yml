# A note about OSX:
# Homebrew uses a massive git repository, that gets updated very frequently.
# This leads to homebrew taking forever to update its package definition on
# every single CI run.
# It also means a new release of libsodium could potentially break our build.
# As a result, instead of relying on the Homebrew-provided formula,
# the bottle used had been extracted, and is force-fed to brew.
