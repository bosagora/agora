# Stellar Consensus Protocol code

This code has been extracted from [stellar-core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core).
It is built as a dependency of `agora`, and bindings are written in [the D Programming Language](https://dlang.org/) to interact with it.

The path of each file matches the path in `stellar-core` relative to the root of the git repository, in order to make comparison and updating simpler.
Files in `extra` are extra C++ files added to the build (e.g. to instantiate templates so the D side can use it).

Commit used for extraction: [v11.2.0](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases/tag/v11.2.0)

# Porting notes

Some files have been modified after porting:

- Some `private` declarations were changed to `public`. This allows us to test size & layout checks for our D glue layer, for example: https://github.com/bpfkorea/agora/blob/76e4ca7d77b123ef867d3ce99c1c1b26afab761d/source/scpp/src/crypto/ByteSlice.h#L21 used in https://github.com/bpfkorea/agora/blob/76e4ca7d77b123ef867d3ce99c1c1b26afab761d/source/scpp/extra/DSizeChecks.cpp and https://github.com/bpfkorea/agora/blob/76e4ca7d77b123ef867d3ce99c1c1b26afab761d/source/scpp/extra/DLayoutChecks.cpp.

- The `src/quorum` folder contains the Quorum intersection code which is used in stellar-core. It was adapted to not depend on any stellar-specific type definitions. The `update.d` script does not track these files yet, so they have to be kept manually in sync when updating the bindings.

# Update process

- Checkout stellar-core
- Perform a full build (not an installation) using [Stellar's instructions](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
- Copy the required files
- Update the bindings

The full build step is required to make sure the `.h` for XDR are up to date, as there is no XDR -> D converter, we use XDR -> C++ -> D instead.
Alternatively, one can use the experimental `update.d` update script.
