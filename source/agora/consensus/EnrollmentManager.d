/*******************************************************************************

    Manages this node's Enrollment, the `ValidatorSet`, and `EnrollmentPool`

    This class currently has 3 responsibilities:
    - It's a bridge to the `ValidatorSet`, where the list of currently active
      validators is stored;
    - It stores `Enrollment`s that are not yet part of the validator set;
    - Most importantly, if this node is a validator, it manages this node's
      enrollement data, including pre-images.

    The consensus protocol requires each validator to commit to a hash and
    to reveal a pre-image for the next `ValidatorCycle` blocks (currently 1008).
    That newly-revealed hash is used as a basis for various operations,
    such as deriving the new signature noise (in order to make signature
    aggregation possible) and both as a source of randomness for the node
    itself (e.g. for the quorum balancing) and as part of the network
    randomness function, when aggregated with other node's pre-images.
    As a result, revealing the pre-image in time is absolutely critical and
    not doing so will lead to penalties.

    In order to ensure that we will never lose the ability to reveal
    pre-images, this implementation uses a reproducible scheme:
    on the first run, we generate a "cycle seed" which is derived from a hash
    of the private key, a constant string, and a nonce, starting from 0.
    Using this cycle seed, we generate a large amount of pre-images
    (currently enough for 100 enrollments). Then out of this range of
    [0 .. 100_800] pre-images, we reveal the last 1008 (`ValidatorCycle`),
    or in D terms `[$ - 1008 .. $]`.
    When the first enrollment runs out, we reveal the next last 1008,
    or in D terms `[$ - 2016 .. $ - 1008]`.
    When the cycle is expired, we re-generate a new cycle seed after
    increasing the nonce.
    By using this scheme, a node that would start from scratch with
    an already-enrolled key will be able to recover its nonce and
    cycle index by scanning the blockchain, and resume validating.
