    The set for consensus-critical constants

    This defines the class for the consensus-critical constants. Only one
    object should exist for a single node. The `class` is `immutable`, hence
    the constants need to be set at the start of the process. The
    consensus-critical constants are the protocol-level constants, so they
    shouldn't be modified outside of test environments.
