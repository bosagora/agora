/*******************************************************************************

    Expose facilities used by the `Node` to communicate with the network

    The `NetworkManager` is responsible for managing the view of the network
    that a `Node` has.
    Things such as peer blacklisting, prioritization (which peer is contacted
    first when a message has to be sent), etc... are handled here.

    In unittests, one can replace a `NetworkManager` with a `TestNetworkManager`
    which provides a different client type (see `getClient`) in order to enable
    in-memory network communication.

        Retrieve the clock time of each node in the given quorum set,
        and return the median time.

        The threshold is taken into account.

        Taking request / response delays into account:
        ==============================================

        We cannot assume why a getLocalTime() request response was late.
        Assume N1 and N2 are two nodes and the time is 10:00:00 at both nodes.
        An 'upstream' delay means a request delay from N1 -> N2,
        and a 'downstream' response is the delay from N2 -> N1:

        1 second delay:

        10:00:00 N1 -> N2.getLocalTime() (10:00:01)
        10:00:01 N1 <- 10:00:01
        A: Received 10:00:01 at 10:00:01 with a 1 second delay

        15-second delay upstream, no delay downstream:
        10:00:00 N1 -> N2.getLocalTime()  (10:00:15)
        10:00:15 N1 <- 10:00:15
        B: Received 10:00:15 at 10:00:15 with a 15 second delay

        No delay upstream, 15-second delay downstream:
        10:00:00 N1 -> N2.getLocalTime() (10:00:00)
        10:00:15 N1 <- 10:00:00
        C: Received 10:00:00 at 10:00:15 with a 15 second delay

        If we were to just take the total request time into account then the
        calculated time would be:

        A: Received 10:00:01 - 1s delay  => It was 10:00:00 at the start.
        B: Received 10:00:15 - 15s delay => It was 10:00:00 at the start.
        C: Received 10:00:00 - 15s delay => It was 10:59:45 at the start.

        The C calculation is wrong. We assumed N2 received the request late,
        but it was the response to N1 that was delayed.

        To compensate:

        - We set the request timeout to a low value. Limiting it to a small
          value allows for more accurate drift time calculations.

        - We divide the resulting time drift by 2. This essentially splits the
          time drift evenly between upstream and downstream and assumes
          that there is an equal delay between sending a request and receiving a
          response. Most of the time this will be a correct assumption.

        Examples:

        2-second delay upstream, no delay downstream:
        10:00:00 N1 -> N2.getLocalTime()  (10:00:02)
        10:00:02 N1 <- 10:00:02
        B: Received 10:00:02 at 10:00:02 with a 2 second delay

        No delay upstream, 2-second delay downstream:
        10:00:00 N1 -> N2.getLocalTime() (10:00:00)
        10:00:02 N1 <- 10:00:00
        C: Received 10:00:00 at 10:00:02 with a 2 second delay

        1-second delay upstream, 1-second delay downstream:
        10:00:00 N1 -> N2.getLocalTime() (10:00:01)
        10:00:02 N1 <- 10:00:01
        C: Received 10:00:01 at 10:00:02 with a 2 second delay

        Then the calculation is:

        A: Received 10:00:02 - (2s delay / 2) => It was 10:00:01 at the start.
        B: Received 10:00:00 - (2s delay / 2) => It was 10:00:01 at the start.
        C: Received 10:00:01 - (2s delay / 2) => It was 10:00:00 at the start.

        The actual times then only drift by up to `timeout / 2`, and in most
        cases where there is roughly equal delay upstream and downstream this
        time offset will be correct.
