/*******************************************************************************

    Expose facilities used by the `Node` to communicate with the network

    The `NetworkManager` is responsible for managing the view of the network
    that a `Node` has.
    Things such as peer blacklisting, prioritization (which peer is contacted
    first when a message has to be sent), etc... are handled here.

    In unittests, one can replace a `NetworkManager` with a `TestNetworkManager`
    which provides a different client type (see `getClient`) in order to enable
    in-memory network communication.
