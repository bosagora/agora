    /***************************************************************************

        Requests collaboratively closing an existing channel with this peer.

        If the called node accepts the close request and plans to return the
        signature, it should mark the channel as `PendingClose` and should
        reject all subsequent attempts at updating the channel state.

        If the peer unreasonably rejects or ignores closure requests for up to
        `cooperative_close_timeout` as set up in the config,
        the counter-party might trigger a unilateral close of the channel.

        Note that `cooperative_close_timeout` is not enforceable, it's only
        used as an intended timeout used by both peers. The `settle_time` of
        the settlement branch in the trigger / update transactions is the only
        enforcable parameter by the blockchain, therefore the node should always
        monitor the blockchain for any premature publishing of the trigger
        transaction.

        Params:
