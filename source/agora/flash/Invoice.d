/*******************************************************************************

    Contains the invoice definition.

    A randomly-generated secret is generated, and the hash of it is stored
    in the invoice together with the invoice's amount, expiry,
    and any description.

    The secret should be shared with the party which will pay the invoice.
    The hash of the secret is used in the contract which is shared across
    zero or more channel hops. The payment is realized once the payer reveals
    the secret, and all the channel pairs in the multi-hop channel layout
    have their settle/update transactions signed.
