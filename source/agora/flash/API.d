            peer_nonce = the nonce pair that will be used for signing the
                initial settlement & trigger transactions.

    /***************************************************************************

        Requests collaboratively closing an existing channel with this peer.

        If the called node accepts the close request and plans to return the
        signature, it should mark the channel as `PendingClose` and should
        reject all subsequent attempts at updating the channel state.

        If the peer unreasonably rejects or ignores closure requests for up to
        `cooperative_close_timeout` as set up in the config,
        the counter-party might trigger a unilateral close of the channel.

        Note that `cooperative_close_timeout` is not enforceable, it's only
        used as an intended timeout used by both peers. The `settle_time` of
        the settlement branch in the trigger / update transactions is the only
        enforcable parameter by the blockchain, therefore the node should always
        monitor the blockchain for any premature publishing of the trigger
        transaction.

        Params:
            chan_id = the channel ID to close
            seq_id = the sequence ID

        For example, when waiting for a funding transaction to be externalized
        one peer may detect the externalization event sooner than the
        counter-party. In this case one peer will report the channel as being
        open, while the counter-party might report the channel's state
        as `State.WaitingForFunding`.
