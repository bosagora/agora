## This is a sample, documented configuration file for Agora in YAML format
##
## It is not intended for usage on any network
##
## A node has two interfaces: one for network communication,
## and one for administration.
## The one communicating with the network is public,
## while the administrative is unsecured, disabled by default,
## and should not be exposed to the outside world.
## The administrative one is unsecured and should not be exposed to the outside
## world. It is disabled by default for security purpose.

##                               Logging options                              ##
##                                                                            ##
## Our logging system is hierarchical: Logger names are, e.g. `a.b.c.d`.      ##
## Inside agora, every module that logs have a module-level logger matching   ##
## it's module name, e.g. `agora.node.main`.                                  ##
##                                                                            ##
## In addition, some modules can have more nested loggers: one such use case  ##
## is for a module which deals with client connections, which we'll refer to  ##
## as `agora.network.Client` here. Such a module would produce a confusing    ##
## output if it was logging all clients interactions at module level, because ##
## such interactions are intertwinned and requests/responses would be hard to ##
## follow. Hence, using a predictable identifier to extend the hierarchy,     ##
## such as the public key (when dealing with validators), would lead to the   ##
## following loggers: `agora.network.Client.GABC`,                            ##
## `agora.network.Client.GEFG`, `agora.network.Client.G1234`, etc...          ##
##                                                                            ##
## When configuring loggers, the configuration applies to the referenced      ##
## hierarchy and any child. Using the previous example, configuring           ##
## `agora.network` will lead to all clients having the same configuration,    ##
## as well as the module `agora.network.Foobar`.                              ##
##                                                                            ##
